Let:

- \( M_v \) = meat mass (in kg),
- \( C \) = desired salt concentration in % (and thus in degrees, since 1° = 1%),
- \( m_{salt} \) = mass of salt to weigh (in g).

Formula:

\[
m_{salt} \text{ (g)} = M_v \text{ (kg)} \times C \times 10
\]

Justification:
1 kg = 1000 g → 1% of 1000 g = 10 g → hence the factor of 10.

Examples:

- 2° on 3 kg → \( 3 \times 2 \times 10 = 60 \) g salt.
- 3° on 1.5 kg → \( 1.5 \times 3 \times 10 = 45 \) g salt.
